# 1D 1D Chemokine Gradient Simulation in Heterogeneous Tumors

This directory contains the original R code and data files for simulating a 1D chemokine gradient in heterogeneous tumors. The objective of this simulation is to replicate observed T-cell distributions within tumors based on the chemokine field generated by cancer cells. The project was inspired by the study:

Tanaka, Miho et al. "Tumor cell heterogeneity drives spatial organization of the intratumoral immune response in squamous cell skin carcinoma." bioRxiv, doi:10.1101/2023.04.25.538140.

Contents

R Scripts

TumorDataModel.R: Core R script for simulating chemokine gradients and optimizing fit to observed T-cell data.

Data

Data/: Contains tumor cell positional data, cell type classifications, and supporting tumor imagery.

DataTransformation.R: Transforms raw input data into a format compatible with the simulation script.

Documentation

ProjectSummary.pdf: Summarizes project objectives, methods, key results, and conclusions.

Requirements

R

R packages: ggplot2, philentropy, gganimate, av

Output

The script outputs visualizations and KL divergence metrics comparing simulated and empirical T-cell distributions.
